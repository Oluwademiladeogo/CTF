Moved interfaces to a separate "types" file
Why are there two user models??
Get endpoint for some user routes not needed
In the verify otp what is happening(why updating the user email)?
Removed salt option on signupuserdto
WHy is a verify object passed into the User Model
The name of the "Users" doc should be changed to User
